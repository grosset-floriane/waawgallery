    <h3 id="intro">On the importance of web-based art</h3>
    <p>After 30 years of fast technological development and exponential content growth,
    the web belongs to our daily narratives and anyone trying to escape it loses their
    credibility as they don’t play the rules of the contemporary social community. Like
    most humans’ creation, the web is one more invention for which we struggle to
    predict and understand the impact that it has and will have on our lives.</p>

    <p>It is even more important to question the place Internet has in our life here, in Norway
    because it stands as one of the most digitized countries of the world: credit cards
    replace almost completely cash, the FM radio ceased, apps are omnipresent (student
    identifications, transportation cards, etc.) and information moved progressively
    on the net.</p>

    <h3 id="aboutWaaw">What is WAAW?</h3>
    <p>WAAW is a non-profit web gallery, led by <a href="http://florianegrosset.com">Floriane Grosset</a>, that invites artists to
    create web-based art works and provides technical help. Every two and a half
    months, a new collaboration between the artist and the gallery starts. 
    The result will be exhibited on this very website and at
    <a href="zipcollective.com">.ZIP Collective</a>, an artist collective based in Bergen, Norway.</p>

    <h3 id="projectPurpose">What is the purpose of the project?</h3>
    <p>The aim of WAAW gallery is to promote and help the creation of quality web-based
    art works. The gallery will give most of its support to young unestablished
    artists based in Norway. The support will take the form of technical coding
    assistance and possibly remuneration that will come from national or regional
    funds. In addition to its local action, WAAW gallery aspires to democratize the
    free access and diffusion of art world wide, and will connect with 
    similar projects internationnally.</p>

    <h3 id="expandingOffline">Expanding the digital world into the physical one</h3>
    <p>The virtual space is the consequence of actions, social connections and
    production that are anchored and developed offline and with tangible people
    aiming to work and create together. On the other side, due to its omnipresence, the
    technologies we use daily and what is happening online shape our interactions,
    our convictions and our actions. In addition to the impact the web has on us as
    humans, it has important consequences: on the society — f.ex. It has the power
    to create communities but also inequalities; on the structures of power — f.ex. It
    shapes our vision of the world leaders by their actions and the propaganda; and
    on the environment — f.ex. the web is embodied in servers that consume lots of
    energy and demand a high rate of extraction of rare metals.</p>
    <p>Because of the permanent interrelation of virtual and material, it is important
    to locally recontextualize the works in a physical gallery and question the
    connections that already exist and need to be made between the two worlds we
    have built. Therefore, for each of the online openings, an opening will be given at
    the physical gallery of .ZIP Collective. The artists
    will have to reflect on how the work has to be shown and might include previous
    works that they have made or works from other invited artists that give another
    perspective on similar questions.</p>

    <h3 id="sustainability">A word on sustainability</h3>
    <p>The gallery space is hosted on a eco-friendly server (<a href="https://www.
    ecowebhosting.co.uk/">https://www.
    ecowebhosting.co.uk/</a>). The philosophy of the gallery is to encourage a
    sustainable creation from using recycled and borrowed materials, machines and
    tools, to avoid the production of waste and unnecessary flight travels. Therefore,
    the invited artists are mostly Bergen-based and will be encouraged to travel by
    bus or train in the case of exhibitions outside of Bergen. In addition, most of the
    promotion will be communicated online on social media and by email, and only a
    few eco-friendly posters could be printed and hung at .ZIP Collective.
