        This project is an attempt to make a divination with an exploded film. 
        Elements of the film (images, archives, videos, sounds, texts, news, 
        etc.) are provided by the artist. However the cutting of the film is 
        let to hazard ; and the story it tells, to the viewer. A film will 
        last 100s then the page will be reloaded, and the previous film will 
        be lost. Each element will appear in the web page on the top of the 
        previous element. However, elements won’t disappear, but play in a 
        loop until the end of the film.

        3500 years ago, Shang dynasty used to burn animal bones to 
        communicate with their gods and ancestors, to ask them about 
        the future of the kingdom.Writing their questions, then the 
        answers on the bones. They burned it multiple times, 
        interpreting the shape of the cracks, the flames themselves 
        or the sounds of the bone burning ?<br>
        Questions, predictions and answers, all engraved on bones 
        and fire, receptacle of stories and writings of the past.</p>

        <p>Augurs, bad or good omens, sibyllins words, futures 
            glimpsed in ritualized hazards, Influencing and shaping 
            the future that they’re looking for. <br>
        Making a film is choosing into an infinity of possibilities, 
        then the story is told. Could a story be told in infinite 
        different ways, and be the same anyway ?
