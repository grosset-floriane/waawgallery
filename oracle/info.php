            Bibliomancy is a divinatory practice used since 
            antiquity to get answers to questions or to predict 
            the future. Through history it has evolved from using
             only sacred books as the Bible or the Quran to the 
             use of entire libraries.</p>

            <p>How to Bibliomancy at home:<br>
            1- Ask a question<br>
            2- Pick randomly a book from your shelf<br>
            3- Open the book at a random location<br>
            4- With your eyes closed slide your finger through the page<br>
            5- Read the answer in the sentence where your finger has stopped</p>

            <p>The Bibliomancy Oracle is a tool to expand 
                the divination practice from physical books 
                to an online library. Using Project Gutenberg’s 
                repository and a custom made algorithm we get 
                Bibliomancy straight to your screen allowing 
                you to get your answers whenever and wherever you are.
            </p>

            <p>Note: Every questions asked to the Bibliomancy Oracle will be recorded and might be used in a coming publication.</p>
