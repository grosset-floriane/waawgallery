            Indoors is a serie of five exhibitions in collaboration with
            the French artist Lola Jacrot. Each exhibition was opening a
            Sunday at 5pm at WAAW gallery from the 12th of April to the
            10th of May. It was an initiative to sustain the cultural life online
            as all the physical galleries and museums were shutting down
            in Europe due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

            <p>During the period of confinement, Lola and I recreated each
            other personal spaces with
            the video game medium.
            We explored the narration
            of our own lives, stopped
            in their courses. We built
            the spaces, we woke up
            again, we daydreamed, we
            disconnected ourselves and
            we thought - a lot - about what
            would be the after world.

                "Lola is the voice in your ear when you turn on your<br>
                computer. If she could, she’d be camping in your<br>
                webcam.<br>
                She’s got your avatar in her living room and she’s feeding<br>
                it weird food. Savoury though. Always savoury.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lola has this way of moving her fingers when she talks about her work. 
                I’d recognise it anywhere. I don’t know if<br>
                she realises how much we examine her too.”<br>

            <p>
                Floriane works with both analogue and digital photography and creates 
                situations to look at images, such as installations or objects, related 
                to the pre-cinematic period. She questions the materiality of images, 
                and the place of the spectator, and the how architecture enclose the 
                bodies and minds. The uncanny, the surveillance and the gaze are notions 
                she constantly explores in her works.
