            Moare is a pattern or optical effect that occurs when two smooth, 
            fine patterns are laid on top of each other and interfere, 
            that is, together form a third pattern.

            SÃ¸ren Krag(b. 1987 in Denmark) produces work within 
            a broad spectrum of artistic disciplines electronic 
            and digital tools. An important part of his practice 
            is 'painting' digital images using very basic software. 
            The span of this practice ranges from a kind of abstract 
            geometric minimalism to the production of large scale 
            works. In his work Krag draws on esthetic ideas of 
            symmetry and patterns that permeate the history of 
            art in diverse locations and periods.
