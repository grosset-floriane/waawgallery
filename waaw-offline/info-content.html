        <h3>The Oracle Has Spoken<br>
            <span class="artist-name">Lucila Mayol</span>
        </h3>

        <p>Departing from the idea of chance and
            mysticism conveyed in the Bibliomancy
            practice, from which Lucila takes the
            rules and aleatory elements to develop
            her work. From the sentences collected
            from the online Bibliomancy Oracle,
            Lucila Mayol will map them randomly
            over the space of the exhibition.

        <h3>Moiré VIII<br>

            <span class="artist-name">Søren Krag</span>
        </h3>

        <p>Moiré is a pattern or optical effect that occurs when two smooth,
            fine patterns are laid on top of each other and interfere, that
            is, together to form a third pattern.<br>

            In his new work, Søren will present how his digital Moiré has evolved.

        <h3>Outdoors<br>
            <span class="artist-name">Fleur Delaville & Lola Jacrot</span>
        </h3>
        <p>During the period of confinement, Lola and Fleur
            recreated each other personal spaces with the
            video game medium. They explored the narration
            of our own lives, stopped in their courses.</p>




        <p>Fleur and Lola explored each other cities on
            Google maps, searching for liminal spaces -
            locations that are a transition between two
            other locations, or states of being. Often
            empty and uncanny, they hold the potentiality
            of transgression and self-state transformations.</p>

        <h3>Memories of our fires, or global pyromancy attempt<br>
            <span class="artist-name">Sandy Kalaydjian</span>
        </h3>

        <p>Augurs, bad or good omens, sibylline words, futures glimpsed
            in ritualized hazards, Influencing and shaping the future
            that they’re looking for.<br>

            Making a film is choosing into an infinity of possibilities,
            then the story is told. Could a story be told in infinitely
            different ways, and be the same anyway?<br>

            Sandy will expand in three dimensions and loop her work over the space of the gallery.</p>
